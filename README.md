# Angular Reactive Forms Improved

- Really the only point of this is I like the official documentation except when the sample code is all (or mostly) wrapped up in the app component.  Every time I need to do something it usually has its own module, etc., so, I created a version that at least shows it going down a level, adding some routing, and basic styles along the way without relying on a library.  I hope it helps.
